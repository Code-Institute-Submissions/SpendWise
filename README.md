## Description
The expenses tracker app is a website designed to help users track their spending and stay within their budget. With this app, users can easily add expenses as they occur, and the app will automatically calculate the total amount spent.

The user can also set an initial budget and the app will automatically deduct your expenses from your budget, giving you an up-to-date picture of your spending.

To use the app, users start by specifying an initial budget. They can then add expenses by entering the amount spent, along with a description of the expense. The app will subtract the total amount of the expenses from the total budget, so users can easily see how much they have left to spend.

The app is designed to be user-friendly, with a simple interface that makes it easy to enter and track expenses.

Overall, the expenses tracker app is a useful tool for anyone who wants to stay on top of their finances and make sure they are staying within their budget.
